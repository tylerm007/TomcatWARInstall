{{productFullName}} simplifies and accelerates creating RESTful servers, 
with declarative definition of the services typically found in an App Server:<br/><br/>

<ol>

<li><strong>API: </strong>point-and-click document-oriented endpoints, complementing the default API created from your schema,
with pagination, optimistic locking, and generated primary key propagation to child data.
<br/><br/></li>

<li><strong>Integration:  </strong>resources can combine data from multiple sources (SQL, Mongo and RESTful), and coordinate updates between them.
<br/><br/></li>

<li><strong>Logic Enforcement: </strong>database integrity with a combination of spreadsheet-like Rules and server-side JavaScript.
<br/><br/></li>

 <li><strong>Security Enforcement: </strong>controls end-point access, and row/column security.
<br/><br/></li>

</ol>
Specify your settings in the <b>{{productSlimName}}</b>;  activation is instantaneous - 
no code gen, no deployment.<br/><br/>
Use the <strong>Data Explorer</strong>, created from the schema, to test your API, and for back-office database maintenance.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Flexible Deployment - </strong> both the RESTful service and database can be 
in the cloud, or on-premise (VMware image).  You can also use the war file, to deploy into 
your own container.
<br/><br/>
Use your own existing database, or the pre-supplied empty database in the <strong>Your Database</strong> project.
