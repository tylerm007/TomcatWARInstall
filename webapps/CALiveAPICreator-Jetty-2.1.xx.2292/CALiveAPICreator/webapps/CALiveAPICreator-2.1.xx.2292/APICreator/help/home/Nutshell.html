<h4>Nutshell</h4>
<br>{{productFullName}} enables you to rapidly create and deploy a REST/JSON server.

<br><br>
You avoid tedious and repetitive boilerplate code
by expressing business and security logic using
simple business-oriented <em>spreadsheet-like expressions</em>.

<br><br>
Server-side JavaScript is supported for integrating enterprise data, complex logic, etc.

<br><br>{{productSlimName}} consists of two main components:
<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>{{brandPrefixName}} {{productFullName}}</strong> (you're in it now) to specify
your database location, your API, your logic (rules), and your security settings. <br>
These are accessed via the Navigation Bar to the left.
Note that debug support is provided with logs and the JavaScript Debugger.
</li>
<li>The <strong>{{productSlimName}} Server</strong> stores these settings, and enforces them in the course of responding to REST retrieval / update requests for your data.</li>
</ol> 

<br><br>This Live API is a service, so there's nothing to install or configure.

<h3>Data Explorer</h3>
<br>The Data Explorer provides Master/Detail and Forms Navigation, starting from a Base Table or Resource.
It uses your Live API, so Security and Live Logic are applied to all requests.

<a id="live-api"></a>
<br><br>
<h3>Live API</h3>
You start by creating a Project, where you register your database. 
Once completed, your <em>default</em> REST API is operational. 
<br><br>

Your Resource end points are the tables and Stored Procedures (if any), 
and can be accessed via the Data Explorer or the REST Lab.
<br><br>

Use the {{productFullName}} for point-and-click definition of <em>Custom Multi-Table RESTful Resource End Points</em>, which provide:
<ol>
<li>A Custom API, providing multi-table <em>document-oriented</em> JSON results, 
aliased / projected columns, etc</li>
<li>SQL automation including filters and join automation for related data</li>
<li>Resource Types provide for results using custom SQL or JavaScript</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>Use the {{productFullName}} to define fine-grained <em>Security</em>, based on these key concepts:
<ol>
<li>Authentication, which defines a users' valid Roles</li>
<li>Authorization, which defines Role Permissions to table rows and columns</li>
<li>Powerful Global values and objects, used in row filters</li>
</ol>

<h3>Live Logic</h3>
<br>Business logic is the set of multi-table computations, validations, and actions (e.g., auditing, cloning, sending mail etc) 
performed during an update.  Logic consists of:
<ol>
<li><strong>Reactive Expressions</strong> - spreadsheet-like expressions that define how data is computed or validated<br>
(e.g., <code><small>Derive balance as sum(purchaseorderList.amount_total where paid=false)</small></code>)<br>
Reactive means the system automatically adjusts data when referenced data is changed,<br>
so for example the balance is reduced when the order is paid.</li>
<li><strong>Server-side Java Script </strong>- the system builds an Object Model with attribute/object
accessors, persistence, and events for insert, update and delete.</li>
</ol>

Accessed via Live Logic in the Navigation Bar to the left, you can achieve enormous savings in work:
<ol>
<li>First Look - Explore the logic in Demo API</li>
<li>Closer Look - complex examples (e.g. Bill of Materials), and logic patterns</li>
</ol>

<h3>Database</h3>
<br>When you create a project, you associate it with a database. 
You can specify a new cloud database, 
or an existing database located on-premise or in the cloud.
