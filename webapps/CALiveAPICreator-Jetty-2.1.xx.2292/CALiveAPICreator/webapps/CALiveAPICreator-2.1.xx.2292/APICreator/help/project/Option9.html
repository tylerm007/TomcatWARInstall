<h3>Chunk Size Default</h3>
Rows for Sub Resource query.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, A Resource Customers and a sub-resource Orders is created.
The system reads 20 customers (the first page in a single query),
<br/>
and issues <em>one - not 20</em> additional SQL to retrieve
orders for any of the 20 customers.
<br/>
<br/>
A typical value might be something like 20.
