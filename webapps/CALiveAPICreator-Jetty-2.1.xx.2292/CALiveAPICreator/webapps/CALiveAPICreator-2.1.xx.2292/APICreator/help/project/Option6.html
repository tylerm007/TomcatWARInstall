<h3>Inline Limit Default</h3>
Default value for the maximum size CHAR/BINARY object to include its contents in the response.
<br/><br/>
In other words, if a text or binary value is greater than this many characters/bytes, its contents
will not be returned inline: instead, a URL will be returned that allows retrieval of the full
value.
<br/><br/>
Can be changed on a per request basis with 'inlinelimit' parameter.
<br/><br/>
See also per request 'inline' and 'deferred' parameters.
