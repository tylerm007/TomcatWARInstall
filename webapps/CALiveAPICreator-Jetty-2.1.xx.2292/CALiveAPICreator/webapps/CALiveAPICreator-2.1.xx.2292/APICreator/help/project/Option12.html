<h3>Permit authorization parameter in URL</h3>
If this option is true, then API users may specify their Auth Token on the URL
using the <code>&hellip;&amp;auth=123456789:1</code> format.
<p/>
This may be desirable if users want to make GET requests straight from a browser,
or if for whatever reason they cannot set HTTP headers. (POST/PUT/DELETE also support this,
but normally this is not useful)
<p/>
Obviously, this has security implications,
since URLs can be remembered by browsers, are typically logged in servers, routers, etc...
<p/>
<em>Notice:</em> if this option is false, you will not be able to retrieve
the contents of blobs from an HTML document using an href, since there is no way
for an href attribute to specify a header when retrieving a resource.
