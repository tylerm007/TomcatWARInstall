<h3>Project authentication provider</h3>

The REST API for your project is always accessed using an Auth Token.
But often you may want users to use a name/password combination to authenticate.
<p/>
{{productFullName}} includes a mechanism for defining users and passwords, and a service (using REST, of course)
to convert a set of credentials (typically user name and password) into a usable Auth Token.
<p/>
If you need such a service, you should choose the <em>Built-in authentication</em> option.
If you expect to use Auth Tokens directly, you can leave this blank.
