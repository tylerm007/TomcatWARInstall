<h3>Metadata name</h3>
In the JSON objects that get returned by {{productFullName}}, there is a special section which, by default, is called <code>@metadata</code>.
In some environments, this name may be a problem. Using this option, you can change this to a different name that works better for your project.
<p/>
The name you choose (if you decide to use this option) should be unique enough that it is highly unlikely to clash with a column name
or a resource attribute name. Something like <code>__metadata__</code> would be typical.
