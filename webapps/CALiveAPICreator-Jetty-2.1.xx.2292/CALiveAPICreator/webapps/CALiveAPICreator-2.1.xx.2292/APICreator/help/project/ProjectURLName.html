<h3>Project URL name</h3>
The URL for your project's API is composed of several parts, one of which is specific to the project.
That's the URL fragment. It should be (usually) short, and contain only characters that are valid in a URL.
If you use characters that are invalid, they will be automatically replaced with underscores.
<br/>
Project URL names must be unique within your account.
