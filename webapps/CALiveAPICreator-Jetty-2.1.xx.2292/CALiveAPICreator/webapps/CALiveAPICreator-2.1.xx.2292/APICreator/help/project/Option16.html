<h3>Allow Swagger without authentication</h3>
If this option is set to <em>true</em>, then the Swagger schema can be retrieved
without authentication.
<p/>
This is useful because many Swagger consumers do not support authentication (even
though the <a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_blank">Swagger "standard"</a> itself does).
<p/>
The Swagger schema can be retrieved at a URL that looks something like:
<pre>
https://myserver.acme.com/rest/acme/proj1/v1/@docs
</pre>
<p/>
If you need to connect your API to such a Swagger consumer, you can enable
this option temporarily, then turn it off once the API has been retrieved.
