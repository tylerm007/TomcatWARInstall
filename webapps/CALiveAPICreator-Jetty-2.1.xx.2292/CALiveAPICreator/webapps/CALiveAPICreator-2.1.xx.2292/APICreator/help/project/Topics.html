<h3>Topics</h3>
A Topic is an arbitrary grouping for the logic in your system.
<p/>
Each Topic has a name, a summary and a description. It can also be assigned a color
if you want to make visualization easier.

Each topic can be associated with any number of rules. This is useful to help you
organize your rules by use case, or scenario, or business area, or whatever
your system requires.
