<h3>Checksum Size Limit</h3>
In the JSON objects, the Metadata section contains a checksum which is
used for optimistic locking.  Any binary or character data larger than
this, only the LENGTH of the data is used for the checksum.  Objects smaller
than this use the data itself for the checksum calculation.
<p/>
This has a minor impact on performace for BLOB, CLOB, VARBINARY(MAX) columns
where the column data is normally retrieved from the database with
secondary calls.  Making this number smaller than your typical BLOB size
could improve performance in some scenarios.
