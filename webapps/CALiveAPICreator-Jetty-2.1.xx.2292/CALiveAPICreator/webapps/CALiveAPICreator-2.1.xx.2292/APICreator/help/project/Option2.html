<h3>Type base URI</h3>
The base URL for the type name in the metadata / link portion of the response.
<br/>
This string will be used as the basis for the type attribute of links.
It can be anything you want, but we recommend you use something of the following form:
<p/>
<code>urn:&lt;organization-name&gt;:&lt;department&gt;:</code>
<p/>
The data source prefix (for tables and stored procedures) and the entity name will be appended to this.
<p/>
So if you use the value:<br/>
<code>urn:acme:marketing:</code><br/>
then the links will be generated along the lines of:
<code>urn:acme:marketing:db1:Contact</code><br/>
where <code>db1</code> is the data source prefix, and <code>Contact</code> is the name
of the table/resource.
<br/>

An example is provided below.
