<h4>Disallow free-form filters</h4>
When you need maximum flexibility in filtering your data, you can use regular filters, e.g.:
<p/>

<code>.../rest/acme/myproj/v1/Customer?filter=balance&lt;1000</code>
<p/>

There is, however, a serious problem with regular filters: they aren't safe.
This is because a regular filter is basically a piece of SQL code that gets sent directly to the database.
In most cases, that's fine, but this mechanism can be used by malicious persons to access data
they're not supposed to have access to.
<p/>
That's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection" target="_blank">SQL injection</a>,
and it's a frequent cause of unintentional data leaks.
<p/>
Regular filters should be thought of as a prototyping tool: they're quite nice when you want to move fast,
but not appropriate for production systems.
<p/>
So, if security is a concern, you need to turn off regular filters by checking this option.
Once you do so, any request that specifies a <code>filter</code> in the URL will fail.
