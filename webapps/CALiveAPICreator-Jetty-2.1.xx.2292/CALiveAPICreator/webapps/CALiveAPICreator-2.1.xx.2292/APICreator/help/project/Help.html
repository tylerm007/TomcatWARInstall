<h4>API Properties</h4>
An API is an executable set of Resources (End Points) accessed via a RESTful API, consisting of:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Default Resources</strong> are the
		tables, views and stored procedures of one of more underlying Data Sources.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Custom Resources </strong> <em>nest</em> data from
		multiple Data Sources, including control of attributes and their names
	</li>
</ul>
In addition to the API <em>shape</em>, you can configure <strong>logic and security behavior,</strong>
using Reactive (spreadsheet-like) Rules and JavaScript.
<br/>
<br/>
Your API is <strong>live</strong> - instantly executable, no compile or deploy.
Run it in the REST Lab or the Data Explorer.
