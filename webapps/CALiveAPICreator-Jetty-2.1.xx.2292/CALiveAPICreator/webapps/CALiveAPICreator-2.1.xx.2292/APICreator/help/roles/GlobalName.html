<h3>Global name</h3>
A "global" is a variable that will be made available to each transaction, so that it can determine
what data the user should have access to.
<p/>
A global can be used in a permission as part of a filter. For instance, if you define a global
named <i>ssn</i>, and give it a value of '123-45-6789' (in single quotes), then you can use
that value in a permission's predicate, e.g.:
<code>
user_ssn = '@{ssn}' or owner_ssn = '@{ssn}'
</code>
<p/>
Of course, a fixed value is not always interesting. The value is actualy a SQL query
that will execute against your database, so you can retrieve data based on the information
already available to you.
