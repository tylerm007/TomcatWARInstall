<h3>Role Global required</h3>
If a global is required, it must have a value. If it does not have a value, then an error will be thrown,
and the transaction will be aborted.
<p/>
This is useful if you need to make sure that the user has a value for this global. For instance, if you
have some security settings that restrict access to data based on (say) the user's department number,
then making the corresponding global required would guarantee that the user does in fact have 
a department number.
