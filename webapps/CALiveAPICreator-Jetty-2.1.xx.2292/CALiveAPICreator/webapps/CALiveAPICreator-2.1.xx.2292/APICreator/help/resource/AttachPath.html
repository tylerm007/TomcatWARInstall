<h3>Resource - Attach Path</h3>
This field is required for subresources of a Mongo resource.
<p/>
It defines where, in the parent tree, the result of the subresource should be attached.
<p/>
Let's assume that the parent resource returns the following tree:

<pre>
{
  "company_name": "Acme",
  "budget": 100000
  "departments": [
    {
      "name": "Marketing",
    },
    {
      "name": "Accounting"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
<p/>
Now let's assume that the subresource will add the employees (from e.g. a SQL database) to the departments.
In this case, the attach path would be:
<code>departments.employees</code>
and the resulting tree would look something like:
<pre>
{
  "company_name": "Acme",
  "budget": 100000
  "departments": [
    {
      "name": "Marketing",
      "employees": [
        {
          "emp_name": "Jane Doe"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Accounting",
      "employees": [
        {
          "emp_name": "Jane Doe"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

With this attach path, the parent "row" for the subresource will be the department object, and its attributes
(in this example, just the "name" attribute) will be available in the join expression.
