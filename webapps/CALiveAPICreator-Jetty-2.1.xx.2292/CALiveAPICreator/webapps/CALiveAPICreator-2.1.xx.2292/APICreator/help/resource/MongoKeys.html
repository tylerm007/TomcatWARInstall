<h3>Mongo keys</h3>
This optional field can specify which keys (or attributes) should be included
in the Mongo resource.
<p/>
A simple example: if your Mongo resource has attributes <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>
and <code>balance</code>, and you want to include only attributes name and balance, you can use either:
<pre>
	{name: 1, balance: 1}
</pre>
or you specify the opposite, i.e. do not include the age attribute:
<pre>
	{age: 0}
</pre>
<p/>
This field can actually do quite a bit more than that -- it is passed to MongoDB as the second
parameter of the <code>find</code> method. For instance, you could use Mongo's
projection capabilities, e.g.:
<pre>
	{ coordinates: {$slice: 2} }
</pre>
which would return only the first values from the array named "coordinates".
