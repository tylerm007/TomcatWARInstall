<h3>Resource - Resource Type</h3>

There are three different types of resources:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Normal</strong> is the most common case: these are resources that join together one or more table, allowing you
	to alias the table(s) and columns, and specify joins and filters.
	<li><strong>Free SQL</strong> is for resources where you manually specify the SQL to execute. These resources are read-only,
	but they do give you full latitude to set up the SQL any way you want.
	<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> resources are the most difficult, and the most advanced: they allow you to write server-side
	JavaScript code that will be executed whenever this resource is accessed. Your JavaScript code will be responsible
	for retrieving data, and for formatting it into JSON. The most common use for this resource type is to make
	a call to an outside REST service.
</ul>
