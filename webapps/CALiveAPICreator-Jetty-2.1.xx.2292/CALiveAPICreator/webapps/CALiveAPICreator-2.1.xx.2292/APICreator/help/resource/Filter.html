<h3>Filter</h3>
This is a way to specify additional filtering on the resource, e.g. if you want
to restrict the rows that should be returned by the resource.
<p/>
For SQL resources, this should simply be a fragment of a where expression, e.g.:
<code>amount_total &lt; 1000 and paid = 'Y'</code>
<p/>
For Mongo resources, you should use the Mongo syntax, e.g.:
<code>{"$and": [{"$lt": {"amount_total": 1000}}, {"paid": "Y"}]}</code>
