<h3>Resource: Join condition</h3>

This defines how the currently selected resource should be joined with the containing resource.
<p/>
You can refer to columns in the table of the containing resource using the following notation:

<code>customer_number = [custnum] and region_ident = [regident]</code>

In this example, <code>customer_number</code> and <code>region_ident</code> are columns of the
current resource's table, and <code>custnum</code> and <code>regident</code> are columns
of the table for the containing resource.
<p/>
This box may get pre-filled for you if there is a foreign key in the database that fits
the definition of the resource. If that is the case, you can still modify it if you wish.

<h3>MongoDB resources</h3>
For MongoDB resources, the join uses Mongo syntax, which is somewhat different.
Whereas in SQL, you might do something like:
<code>CompID = [CompanyID] AND CustID = [CustomerID]</code>
Mongo's syntax would be:
<code>{"$and": [{"CompID": "&lt;CompanyID&gt;"}, {"CustID": "&lt;CustomerID&gt;"}]}</code>
In particular, notice that the bracket notation is different -- this is because square brackets
are meaningful in JSON.
