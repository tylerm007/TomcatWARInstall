<h3>Resource - Is a collection</h3>

This checkbox describes whether the currently selected resource (in the Resource Tree)
is expected to be a single row at most, or potentially more than one row.
<p/>
Put another way, it defines whether the table for the resource in question is a "child"
table of the containing resource's table.
<p/>
A top-level resource should normally be a collection.
<p/>
A sub-resource is a collection if there can be many rows for a single row in the containing resource.
<p/>
If a sub-resource is for a table that is a "parent" table of the containing resource's table, then
it should <b>not</b> be a collection, since at most one row can be expected.
