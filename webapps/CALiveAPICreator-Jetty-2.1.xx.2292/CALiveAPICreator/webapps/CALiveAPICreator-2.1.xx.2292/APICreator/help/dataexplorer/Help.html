<h4>Data Explorer</h4>

<h6>What is this?</h6>
The 
<a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/data-explorer" target="_blank"><strong>Data Explorer</strong></a> 
gives you complete read/write access to your data:
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>No coding required</strong> - it is created from your schema, and stays in sync with schema changes<br/><br/></li>
<li>It uses the RESTful API, so <strong>enforces logic and security</strong> <br/><br/></li>
<li>It is  <strong>configurable</strong> as described below<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<h6>What is the intended usage?</h6>
It is intended for 'backoffice' data maintenance apps, a complement to your custom apps.  
Both Data Explorer and your custom apps share the common Live API, including Logic and Security enforcement.
<br/><br/>

<h6>Can I configure it?</h6>
Use Author Mode to customize many aspects of appearance:
<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>What fields are displayed, in what order<br/><br/></li>
<li>Presentation rules, such as when to hide, disable or highlight data<br/><br/></li>
<li>Style sheets, to control colors, fonts and logos<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<h6>How can I explore the interaction with Live API and Live Logic?</h6>
Zoom into an Order, and alter an Order Detail Quantity.  Observe the change to the Customer Balance.<br>
