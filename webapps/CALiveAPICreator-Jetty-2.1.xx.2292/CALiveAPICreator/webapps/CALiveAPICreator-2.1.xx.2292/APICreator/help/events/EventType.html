<h3>Event Type</h3>
The event type determines when this event handler will be called:
<ul>
	<li>a <strong>request event</strong> is invoked right after a request has been received, but before any "serious" work
	has begun. Your request handler will have access to all the relevant information, such as which Auth Token is being used,
	what the request verb is (GET, POST, etc...), the JSON payload for POST and PUT, and what the URL parameters are.
	<li>a <strong>response event</strong> is invoked after the request has been processed, but before the response is
	sent back to the client. You have the opportunity to do additional work, and even to modify the response (though
	you should be careful when doing that!).
</ul>
