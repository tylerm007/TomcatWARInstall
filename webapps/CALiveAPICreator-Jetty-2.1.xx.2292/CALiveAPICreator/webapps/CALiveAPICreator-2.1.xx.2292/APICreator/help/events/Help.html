<h4>Request Events</h4>
A {{brandPrefixName}} Live API can have any number of   
<a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/reference/event-handlers" target="_blank"><strong>Request Events</strong></a>,  
which will be automatically executed at certain points during a request.
<br/><br/>

There are currently two types of event handlers:<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Request Event Handlers</strong> are called for every request, right after the request has been received, but before any "serious" work has really begun.
<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Response Event Handlers</strong> are called for every request, right before the final result is sent back to the client (assuming the request was successful).
</li>
</ol>
<br/>

For example, you might use Request Events to reject all requests on certain resources if they do not use HTTPS.  
<br/><br/>

Or, define Response Events to modify the request response.
<br/><br/>

Request Events are one of the ways you can

 for implementing behavior.
