<h3>Relationship - Columns</h3>
This defines how the parent table and the child entity are joined.
You must have at least one pair of columns.
<p/>
Remember that:
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>together, the parent columns must be unique
 <li>the parent column and the child column must be of compatible types (e.g. joining a date column to a number column will usually fail)
</ul>
