<h3>Database Test</h3>

The <a class="btn btn-default">Test</a> button attempts to use the information you have provided in the form to
connect to the database and make sure it can be used properly. To do so, a trivial query will be run.
If that query is successful, the test will be considered successful.
<p/>
Note that a database cannot be marked as <em>active</em> until it has been successfully tested.
