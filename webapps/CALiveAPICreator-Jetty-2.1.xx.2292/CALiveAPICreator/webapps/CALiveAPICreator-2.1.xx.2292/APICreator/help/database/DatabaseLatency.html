<h3>Database latency</h3>
Database latency is the average time it takes for a typical query to be sent to the database server, executed, and 
for the results of the query to be returned.
<p/>&nbsp;<p/>
Latency is dependent on a number of factors, but the most critical one is often the distance between CA Technologies Live API server
(which is the client here) and your database server. The Live API server is (usually) based in an Amazon facility
on the East coast of the United States. If your database is far away from that area, every database access will take a long time,
resulting in poor performance. If you have your own instance of a Live API, then you can locate it (or have it relocated)
near your database server.

If the latency to your database is too high, you will notice a significant degradation
in performance.
