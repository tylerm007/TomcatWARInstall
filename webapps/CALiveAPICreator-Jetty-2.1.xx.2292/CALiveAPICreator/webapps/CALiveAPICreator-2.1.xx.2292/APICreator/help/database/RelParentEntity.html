<h3>Relationship - Parent Entity</h3>
This is the parent side of the relationship. The parent entity is the entity (often a SQL table) which conceptually "contains" or "owns" the children rows.
<p/>
A typical example might be that the Company entity would be the parent entity, and the Department entity would be the child entity.
This is because there can be more than one Department per Company.
