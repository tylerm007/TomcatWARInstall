<h4>Database prefix</h4>
If you have more than one active database in your project, you will use the database prefix
to specify which database to use, for instance when defining rules and resources.
<p/>
This should be a short (max. 20 characters), memorable word like "demo" or "customers".
The prefix is case-sensitive.
