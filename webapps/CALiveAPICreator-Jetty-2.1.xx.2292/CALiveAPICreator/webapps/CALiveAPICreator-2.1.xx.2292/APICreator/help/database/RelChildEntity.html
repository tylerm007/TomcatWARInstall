<h3>Relationship - Child Entity</h3>
This is the child side of the relationship. The child entity is the table which conceptually is "contained" or "owned" by the parent entity.
<p/>
A typical example might be that the Company entity would be the parent entity, and the Department entity would be the child entity. 
This is because there can be more than one Department per Company.
