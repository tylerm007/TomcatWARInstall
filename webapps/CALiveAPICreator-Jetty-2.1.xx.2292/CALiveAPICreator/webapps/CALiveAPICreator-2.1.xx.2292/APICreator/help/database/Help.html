<h4>Data Sources</h4>
Each project has a main
<a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/integrate/database/database-concepts" target="_blank"><strong>database</strong></a>
(you can also integrate Mongo databases, and use JavaScript to integrate other data sources).
 <br/><br/>

You can define  
<a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/integrate/database/multiple-databases" target="_blank"><strong>multiple active databases,</strong></a>
each with their own distinct prefix.  Inactive databases may have prefix values that
are not unique.  When an inactive database is made <strong>active</strong>, any active database with the same prefix is made inactive.
<br/><br/>
Multiple entries with the same prefix might be used for test, development, production environments.
<br/><br/>
Relationships can be added manually between tables in <strong>different</strong> databases, even if one is (say) Oracle and the other Azure SQL.
Rules can be used with these manually defined relationships.  Commits will be peformed on a best-efforts basis.
<br/><br/>
Use
<strong>reload schema</strong>
when you have modified your schema, so that {{productFullName}} sees the changes. 
<br/><br/>

Run Project &gt; <strong>Verify</strong> to detect schema / resource issues.
<br/><br/>

<strong>Issues</strong> entries (left nav bar) will be created if your resources refer to tables/columns that no longer exist.
