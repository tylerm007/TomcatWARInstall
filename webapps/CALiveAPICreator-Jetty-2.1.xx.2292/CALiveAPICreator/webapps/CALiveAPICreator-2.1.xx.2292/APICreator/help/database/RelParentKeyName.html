<h3>Relationship - Parent Key Name</h3>
<p>
A foreign key is always defined using a unique set of columns in the parent.
When defined in the database, {{productFullName}} will automatically create and utilize the relationship.
</p>
<p>
When a relationship exists, but is not defined in the database, you can manually add the relationship.
There does NOT need to a unique index or constraint defined in the database to define the relationship.
</p>
<p>
However, {{productFullName}} assumes that the fields you select do represent an unique value.  Runtime errors
will be generated when this assumption is violated.
