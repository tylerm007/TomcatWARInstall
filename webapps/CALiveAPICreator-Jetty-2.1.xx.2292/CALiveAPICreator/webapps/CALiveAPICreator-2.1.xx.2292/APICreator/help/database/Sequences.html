<h3>Sequences</h3>
Oracle typically handles auto-generated keys using sequence objects.
SQL Server 2012 also supports sequences in addition to IDENTITY.
There is no way to know which sequence is used by which table.
<p>
This tab allows you to associate tables that use a sequence with said sequence.
<p>
For each table that uses a sequence, select the column that is set by the sequence,
and the corresponding sequence.
<p>
This can also be used for TRIGGER updated columns and Oracle 12c auto-sequences.  Select the column and leave the sequence value as None.
