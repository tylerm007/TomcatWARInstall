<h3>Relationship - On Update</h3>
This option determines what happens when a parent row's key gets updated. The options are:
<br/>
<ul style="padding: 5px;">
	<li><em>Update</em>: the children rows' foreign keys will be updated to reflect the new parent key
	<li><em>Null</em>: the children rows' foreign keys will be set to null (note that this will result in an error if the foreign key is not nullable)
	<li><em>Restrict</em>: the update of the parent row's key will fail if it has any children rows.
</ul>
