<h4>Managed Parent</h4>

<br><a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/managed-parent" target="_blank"><strong>Managed Parent</strong></a>
 s a type of rule that automatically insert a parent object if it does not already exist when a child is inserted.

This is done using the following algorithm:<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>when a child object is inserted, the logic engine checks whether there are any Managed Parent rules for that table.<br/><br/></li>
<li>if there are, then for each such rule:<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>if the foreign key in the child object is null or incomplete, then nothing happens<br/><br/></li>
<li>if the foreign key in the child object is complete, then the engine looks in the database to verify that the corresponding parent exists<br/><br/><li>
if the parent exists, then nothing happens<br/><br/></li>
<li>if the parent does not exist, it is automatically created, and the attributes used in the foreign key are copied from the child into the new parent, thus establishing the relationship between the two<br/><br/></li>
<li>the new parent is then optionally handed to your JavaScript code for further initialization. You do not need to write any code, unless you want to initialize the parent object beyond what is done automatically<br/><br/></li>
<li>the new parent is then inserted into the database<br/><br/></li>
</ol></li>
 </ol>
