<h4>Rule - SQLable</h4>
It this is true, then this rule can be computed as a SQL expression.
This is true only if the rule follows certain restrictions.
<p/>
This is relevant mostly if this rule computes the value of a 
non-persistent attribute: if this rule is SQLable, the computation 
will be much faster in almost all cases.
