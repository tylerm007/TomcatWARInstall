<h4>Formula</h4>

<br><a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/formula" target="_blank"><strong>Formulas</strong></a>
 are derivation rules that compute the value of a table.column.  They can reference other columns in the row as <code>row.attribute</code>, as well as parent columns.   <br/><br/>
 A list of attribute names is provided via the Espression help link.
<br><br>
 
 They are specified using JavaScript notation.  This supports normal JavaScript services for if/else, looping etc.
<br><br>

Whenever the referenced attributes are changed, the system will invoke your formula so the column value is kept in sync - reactive programming.  
<blockquote>Contrast this with imperative programming, 
where such dependency management often accounts for substantial code to 
detect changes and propagate to dependent data.</blockquote>


Observe that you do not directly invoke your formula logic.  It is invoked during
