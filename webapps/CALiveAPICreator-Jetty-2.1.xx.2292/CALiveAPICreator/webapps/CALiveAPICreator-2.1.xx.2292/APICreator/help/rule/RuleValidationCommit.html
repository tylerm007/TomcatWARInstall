<h3>Commit Validations</h3>
Normal <a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/validation#TOC-Commit-Validations" target="_blank">Validations</a>
are checked as rows are processed, during server update request processing.  <br/><br/>

<strong>Commit validations</strong> are checked only at the <em>end</em> of the transaction, just prior to commit,
when all the logic has been executed for all the rows in the transaction. <br/><br/>

See the <a href=
 "http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/validation#TOC-Requirement:-no-Empty-Orders" target="_blank">No Empty Orders example</a>,
where a commit validation checks the Orders' item count.
