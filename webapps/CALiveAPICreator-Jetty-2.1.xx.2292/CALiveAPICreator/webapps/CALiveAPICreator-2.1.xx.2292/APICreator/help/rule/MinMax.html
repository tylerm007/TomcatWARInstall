 declares a Parent attribute to be maintained as the Min/Max of a designated child role's  attribute, with an optional qualification to filter child objects.   
 Parent reference names are derived from Foreign Key Relationships.
<br/><br/>

Min/Max rules are <br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>Significantly simpler than events<br/><br/></li>
<li>Efficient - parent data is adjusted via a 1 row update - the system does not issue a select min() SQL command</li>
</ol>
