<h4>Validation Rule</h4>
A Validation rule is a JavaScript expression that must return true or false.
It can contain if/else logic, invoke JavaScript functions, and so forth.

If it returns <code>false</code>, then the validation will fail, the database transaction
will be rolled back, and the caller will receive an exception.

The variable <code>row</code> refers to the database row currently being processed.
It may be either inserted, updated or deleted depending on the REST call being made.
