<h4>Validation</h4>
<br><a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/validation" target="_blank"><strong>Validations</strong></a>

 are expressions assigned to a table, that must be true for a transaction to commit.  
 <br/><br/>
 
Failed transactions are rolled back, and a suitable message is returned to the client.
 <br/><br/>
 
 Validations are specified using JavaScript notation, providing an easy way to perform if/else logic, looping, 
 invoke other JavaScript functions such as date, etc.<br/><br/>
 
 They can reference other columns in the row as <code>row.attribute</code>, as well as parent columns.  
 <br/><br/>
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The Expression help link provides a list of attribute names.<br/><br/></li>
 
<li>Changes to parent columns referenced in child logic cascade to all children, so the validation can be rechecked.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
Whenever the validation's table is altered - either directly by the client or through logic chaining - the system verifies that the result values still meet the validation.  This is reactive programming.  
<blockquote>Contrast this with imperative programming, where such dependency management often accounts for substantial code to detect changes and update dependent data.</blockquote>

For example, altering a Line Item may adjust the Purchase Orders amount_total, which adjusts the Customer's balance.  Such derivations are always subjected to validation checks at each level.  
<br/><br/>

So, our transaction might fail due to the following validation:

<blockquote><code>Validation row.balance > row.credit_limit</code></blockquote>

<br><br>It is a <strong>Best Practice</strong> (a
<a href="http://ca-doc.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/logic-patterns" target="_blank"><strong>Key Logic Pattern</strong></a>) 
for validations to reference derivation results, such as the example described below in Commit Validations.
