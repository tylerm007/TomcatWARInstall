Welcome to CA Live API Creator!

This is an evaluation copy. To run it, please run from the command line:

Windows:   Start.bat
Unix/Mac:  sh Start.sh

This should start the server in a few seconds. Make sure that you don't get any error messages.

Once the server is up (it shouldn't take more than 10-15 seconds), you can connect your
web browser to:

http://localhost:8080/APICreator

You should see a login screen. Your user name is admin, and your password is Password1
(you'll be able to change this password once you're logged in).
